# **Where have you seen data visualisations?**

# **What is data visualization?**

> ## [Definition 1:]{style="color:blue;"} The process of transforming data into graphical representations for the purpose of exploration, confirmation, or presentation.

> ## [Definition 2:]{style="color:blue;"} The visual representation and presentation of data to facilitate understanding.

> Definition 2 is by Andy Kirk (The author of "Data Visualisation: A Handbook for Data Driven Design")

# **What is data visualization?**

> ## The visual [representation]{style="color:purple;"} and [presentation]{style="color:purple;"} of [data]{style="color:purple;"} to [facilitate understanding]{style="color:purple;"}.

- How are you going to plot your data?

- Building blocks of charts

    - marks: points, lines, or shapes to represent data

    - attributes: visual variations of marks: different scales, positions, and sizes

> ### Design decisions as a means for communicating to others

- application of interactivity

- features of annotations

- legend, titles, scales, caption

- dimensions of the chart area

> ### Three phases of understanding (Three different cognitive focuses)

Perceiving -> Interpreting -> Comprehending



## Perceiving 

> ## [What do I see?: Reading the chart]{style="color:#980043;"}

- What data is shown?

- What is on x-axis/ y-axis?

- What do colours represent?

- What range of values are displayed?

- Stepped magnitude judgement?

- Where are the least and most/ average?/largest and smallest?

## Interpreting 

- Translate what you see into quantitative and/or qualitative meaning

- Reader's ability to perform relational interpretation

    - Are these patterns normal, expected or unusual?

    - What features are interesting?

    - What features are important given the subject knowledge?

> If you do not have any knowledge about the subject your understanding stops after the perceiving phase.

## Comprehending

> ## [What does it mean to me?]{style="color:#980043;"}

- What does one do with this understanding?

- Have I learned something I did not know before?

- Was it confirmed I did not know before?

> ## Perceiving: What does it [show]{style="color:#980043;"}?

> ## Comprehending: What does it [mean to me]{style="color:#980043;"}?


# Why visualisations?

- Faster grasp: Comprehend huge amount of information into the brain very quickly

- Can inspire new questions and further exploration

- Provide information with less clutter and less space

- More accessible

- Easier to understand

- Easier to explain

- More memorable




# Bad graphs are everywhere!

> ## No one intentionally creates a bad graph. But it happens. Why is that?

---

# How can I develop my ability to produce powerful data visualisations?

> ### Success comes mostly from experience, mostly from trial and error in discovering what works and what doesn't.

## Exploratory vs Explanatory

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}
**Exploratory**

- When you have a whole bunch of data and you are not sure what types of trends, relationships, etc. it contains.

- Find the story that the data has to tell you.

:::


::: {.column width="50%"}
**Explanatory**

- When you already know what the data has to say and you are trying to tell that story to somebody else.

## Three important parties

1. Data

2. Designer

3. Reader

## Data

1. Categorical?

2. Ordinal?

3. Discrete or continuous?

4. How they are bounded?

5. Netwroks/ trees/ hierarchy

6. Collection of items, groups, sets, clusters

7. Spatial field: scalar, vector, tensor

8. Outliers

9. How many dimensions?

## Designer

> ## Planning:

- What is the output format? (printout, mobile app, etc)

- Time scale

- Tools

- Who is your audience (How much assistance do they need?, How familiar are they with the charts?)


-  Identify the goal

    - What point or message are you trying to convey?


    - What information should they be able to learn from your visualisations?
    
    
    - Examples: Compare performances, Identify trends, Find outliers, Find relationshsips
    
## Reader

> ### Contextual considerations for the reader

- Perceiving: What do colors means? What is on x-axis, y-axis?

- In what direction does the reader follow the plot?

- Which types of plots are they familiar with?

# Gestalt Principles of Visual Perception

> ## How do we perceive information?



## Proximity
We perceive objects close to each other as belonging to a group.


```{r, echo=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(iris, aes(x=Petal.Length, y=Petal.Width)) + geom_point() + theme(aspect.ratio = 1)
```


## Similarity

Our brain group objects that share the same colour, shape, and direction

```{r, echo=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(iris, aes(x=Petal.Length, y=Petal.Width, col=Species)) + geom_point() + scale_color_brewer(palette="Dark2") + theme(aspect.ratio = 1)
```

---

```{r, echo=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(iris, aes(x=Petal.Length, y=Petal.Width, shape=Species)) + geom_point() +  theme(aspect.ratio = 1)
```

## Enclosure

We perceive objects as belonging to a group when they are enclosed in a way that creates a boundary or border around them.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
library(ggforce)
ggplot(iris, aes(x=Petal.Length, y=Petal.Width, shape=Species)) + geom_point() + geom_mark_ellipse(aes(label = Species)) +  theme(aspect.ratio = 1)
```

# Preattentive attributes that we can use in our visualisations to direct our readers attention.
