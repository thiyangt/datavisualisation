# **Where have you seen data visualisations?**

# **What is data visualization?**

> ## [Definition 1:]{style="color:blue;"} The process of transforming data into graphical representations for the purpose of exploration, confirmation, or presentation.

> ## [Definition 2:]{style="color:blue;"} The visual representation and presentation of data to facilitate understanding.

> Definition 2 is by Andy Kirk (The author of "Data Visualisation: A Handbook for Data Driven Design")

# **What is data visualization?**

> ## The visual [representation]{style="color:purple;"} and [presentation]{style="color:purple;"} of [data]{style="color:purple;"} to [facilitate understanding]{style="color:purple;"}.

-   How are you going to plot your data?

-   Building blocks of charts

    -   marks: points, lines, or shapes to represent data

    -   attributes: visual variations of marks: different scales, positions, and sizes

# **What is data visualization?**

> ## The visual representation and [presentation]{style="color:purple;"} of data to facilitate understanding.

> Andy Kirk (The author of "Data Visualisation: A Handbook for Data Driven Design")

> ### Design decisions as a means for communicating to others

-   application of interactivity

-   features of annotations

-   legend, titles, scales, caption

-   dimensions of the chart area

# **What is data visualization?**

> ## The visual representation and presentation of data to [facilitate understanding]{style="color:purple;"}.

> Andy Kirk (The author of "Data Visualisation: A Handbook for Data Driven Design")

> ### Three phases of understanding (Three different cognitive focuses)

Perceiving -\> Interpreting -\> Comprehending

## Perceiving

> ## [What do I see?: Reading the chart]{style="color:#980043;"}

-   What data is shown?

-   What is on x-axis/ y-axis?

-   What do colours represent?

-   What range of values are displayed?

-   Stepped magnitude judgement?

-   Where are the least and most/ average?/largest and smallest?

## Interpreting

-   Translate what you see into quantitative and/or qualitative meaning

-   Reader's ability to perform relational interpretation

    -   Are these patterns normal, expected or unusual?

    -   What features are interesting?

    -   What features are important given the subject knowledge?

> If you do not have any knowledge about the subject your understanding stops after the perceiving phase.

## Comprehending

> ## [What does it mean to me?]{style="color:#980043;"}

-   What does one do with this understanding?

-   Have I learned something I did not know before?

-   Was it confirmed I did not know before?

------------------------------------------------------------------------

> ## Perceiving: What does it [show]{style="color:#980043;"}?

> ## Interpreting: What does it [mean]{style="color:#980043;"}?

> ## Comprehending: What does it [mean to me]{style="color:#980043;"}?

# Why visualisations?

-   Faster grasp: Comprehend huge amount of information into the brain very quickly

-   Can inspire new questions and further exploration

-   Provide information with less clutter and less space

-   More accessible

-   Easier to understand

-   Easier to explain

-   More memorable

# Bad graphs are everywhere!

> ## No one intentionally creates a bad graph. But it happens. Why is that?

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# How can I develop my ability to produce powerful data visualisations?

> ### Success comes mostly from experience, mostly from trial and error in discovering what works and what doesn't.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Exploratory vs Explanatory

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
**Exploratory**

-   When you have a whole bunch of data and you are not sure what types of trends, relationships, etc. it contains.

-   Find the story that the data has to tell you.
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
**Explanatory**

-   When you already know what the data has to say and you are trying to tell that story to somebody else.

## Three important parties

1.  Data

2.  Designer

3.  Reader

## Data

1.  Categorical?

2.  Ordinal?

3.  Discrete or continuous?

4.  How they are bounded?

5.  Netwroks/ trees/ hierarchy

6.  Collection of items, groups, sets, clusters

7.  Spatial field: scalar, vector, tensor

8.  Outliers

9.  How many dimensions?

## Designer

> ## Planning:

-   What is the output format? (printout, mobile app, etc)

-   Time scale

-   Tools

-   Who is your audience (How much assistance do they need?, How familiar are they with the charts?)

-   Identify the goal

    -   What point or message are you trying to convey?

    -   What information should they be able to learn from your visualisations?

    -   Examples: Compare performances, Identify trends, Find outliers, Find relationshsips

## Reader

> ### Contextual considerations for the reader

-   Perceiving: What do colors means? What is on x-axis, y-axis?

-   In what direction does the reader follow the plot?

-   Which types of plots are they familiar with?

# Gestalt Principles of Visual Perception

> ## How do we perceive information?

## Proximity

We perceive objects close to each other as belonging to a group.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(iris, aes(x=Petal.Length, y=Petal.Width)) + geom_point() + theme(aspect.ratio = 1)
```

## Similarity

Our brain group objects that share the same colour, shape, and direction

```{r, echo=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(iris, aes(x=Petal.Length, y=Petal.Width, col=Species)) + geom_point() + scale_color_brewer(palette="Dark2") + theme(aspect.ratio = 1)
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

```{r, echo=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(iris, aes(x=Petal.Length, y=Petal.Width, shape=Species)) + geom_point() +  theme(aspect.ratio = 1)
```

## Enclosure

We perceive objects as belonging to a group when they are enclosed in a way that creates a boundary or border around them.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
library(ggforce)
ggplot(iris, aes(x=Petal.Length, y=Petal.Width, shape=Species)) + geom_point() + geom_mark_ellipse(aes(label = Species)) +  theme(aspect.ratio = 1)
```
## Closure

Our brains tend to complete missing parts in the picture.


```{r}
time <- 2000:2020
time <- lubridate::ymd(time, truncated = 2L)
set.seed(5)
aa <- rnorm(15, mean=50, sd=5)
values <- c(aa, NA, NA, NA, 50, 55, 60)
df <- tibble::tibble(time, values)
ggplot(df, aes(x=time, y=values)) + geom_path() + geom_point() + 
  scale_x_date(date_breaks = "1 year",  date_labels = "%Y") + theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust=1))
```

## Connectedness

We perceive objects connected to each other as a single group.

```{r}
time <- 2000:2020
time <- rep(lubridate::ymd(time, truncated = 2L), times= 2)
set.seed(5)
aa <- rnorm(15, mean=50, sd=5)
values <- c(aa, 59, 58, 57, 50, 55, 60)
values <- c(values, values+5)
group <- c(rep(1, 21), rep(2, 21))
df <- tibble::tibble(time, values, group)
ggplot(df, aes(x=time, y=values)) +  geom_point() + 
  scale_x_date(date_breaks = "1 year",  date_labels = "%Y") + theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust=1))
```

---
```{r}
time <- 2000:2020
time <- rep(lubridate::ymd(time, truncated = 2L), times= 2)
set.seed(5)
aa <- rnorm(15, mean=50, sd=5)
values <- c(aa, 59, 58, 57, 50, 55, 60)
values <- c(values, values+5)
group <- c(rep(1, 21), rep(2, 21))
df <- tibble::tibble(time, values, group)
ggplot(df, aes(x=time, y=values, group=group)) +  geom_point() + geom_line() +
  scale_x_date(date_breaks = "1 year",  date_labels = "%Y") + theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust=1))
```

## Continuity

Humans tendency is to see shapes as continuous to the greatest degree possible. The human eye/brain follows lines, curves or a sequence of shapes to create pathways.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
ggplot(mpg) +
    geom_bar(aes(x = class))
```

## Figure and Ground

Human's ability to visually differentiate between an object and its background.

Example 1:

## Simplicity

The law of simplicity indicates that our mind perceives everything in its simplest form.

```{r}
library(gganimate)
p <- ggplot(df, aes(x=time, y=values, group=group)) +
  geom_line() +
  geom_segment(aes(xend=max(time), yend = values), linetype=2, colour='blue') +
  geom_point(size = 3) + 
  geom_text(aes(x = max(time)+.1, label = sprintf("%5.0f", values)), hjust=0) +
  transition_reveal(time) + 
  view_follow(fixed_y = TRUE)+
  coord_cartesian(clip = 'off') + 
  enter_drift(x_mod = -1) + exit_drift(x_mod = 1) +
  theme_bw() +
  theme(panel.border = element_blank(),
        panel.grid.major = element_blank(),
        panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),
        axis.line = element_line(colour = "black"),
        plot.margin = margin(5.5, 40, 5.5, 5.5))
    
animate(p, fps=5)
```



## Common fate 

When objects move in the same direction or at a similar pace, our brains automatically group them together. (eg: a flock of birds)

```{r}
library(gapminder)
library(gganimate)
ggplot(gapminder, aes(gdpPercap, lifeExp, size = pop, colour = country)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.7, show.legend = FALSE) +
  scale_colour_manual(values = country_colors) +
  scale_size(range = c(2, 12)) +
  scale_x_log10() +
  #facet_wrap(~continent) +
  # Here comes the gganimate specific bits
  labs(title = 'Year: {frame_time}', x = 'GDP per capita', y = 'life expectancy') +
  transition_time(year) +
  ease_aes('linear')
```





# Preattentive attributes that we can use in our visualisations to direct our readers attention.

## Exercise 

Draw a plot to show the relationship between Life Expectancy and Countries

```{r, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(gapminder)
library(tidyverse)
gapminder |>
  filter(year == 2007, continent == "Americas") |>
  select(country, lifeExp)
```
